*This is a documentation for a fictional project, just to show you what I expect. Notice a few key properties:*
- *no cover page, really*
- *no copy&pasted assignment text*
- *no code samples*
- *concise, to the point, gets me a quick overview of what was done and how*
- *I don't really care about the document length*
- *I used links where appropriate*

# Overview

This application shows hotels in Bratislava on a map. Most important features are:
- search by proximity to my current location
- search by hotel name
- intelligent ordering - by proximity and by hotel features
- hotels on the map are color coded by their quality assigned in stars (standard)

This application shows Bicycle Tracks in central Slovakia on map. Most important features are:
- Place Marker on a Map and search nearest tracks
- Search Tracks which are near selected amenities
- Show only tracks which can be completed in selected time
- Show nature reserves areas
- Reset map to original state
- Each track has color atribute class which represents ratio of intersection of length in nature reserve to whole length, blue means almost 0 ratio and red means 80% and more
This is it in action:

The application has 2 separate parts, the client which is a [frontend web application](#frontend) using leaflet API and landing.js and [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com). [Backend application](#backend) written in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework, backed by PostGIS. The frontend application communicates with backend using a [REST API](#api).

# Frontend

The frontend application is a static HTML page (`landing.ejs`), which shows a leaflet.js widget. It is displaying bicycle tracks. Each track has color class based on the ratio of its length in nature reserve.

All relevant javascript code is in `landing.js` which is referenced from `landing.ejs`. The frontend code is very simple, its only responsibilities are:
- displaying the leaflet map which shows relevant bicycle tracks
- displaying the sidebar panel user can interact with if he wishes to use features described above like Search for tracks which are near selected amenities, or display nature reserves
- Make Requests on Server to get relevant tracks
- Display Tracks on the map which come from server response

# Backend

The backend application is written in Ruby on Rails and is responsible for querying geo data, formatting the geojson and data for the sidebar panel.

## Data

Hotel data is coming directly from Open Street Maps. I downloaded an extent covering whole Slovakia (around 1.2GB) and imported it using the `osm2pgsql` tool into the standard OSM schema in WGS 84 with hstore enabled. To speedup the queries I created an index on geometry column (`way`) in all tables. The application follows standard Rails conventions and all queries are placed in models inside `app/models`, mostly in `app/models/hotel.rb`. GeoJSON is generated by using a standard `st_asgeojson` function, however some postprocessing is necessary (in `app/controllers/search_controller.rb`) in order to merge all hotels into a single geojson.

## Api

**Find hotels in proximity to coordinates**

`GET /search?lat=25346&long=46346123`

**Find hotels by name, sorted by proximity and quality**

`GET /search?name=hviezda&lat=25346&long=46346123`

### Response

API calls return json responses with 2 top-level keys, `hotels` and `geojson`. `hotels` contains an array of hotel data for the sidebar, one entry per matched hotel. Hotel attributes are (mostly self-evident):
```
{
  "name": "Modra hviezda",
  "style": "modern", # cuisine style
  "stars": 3,
  "address": "Panska 31"
  "image_url": "/assets/hotels/652.png"
}
```
`geojson` contains a geojson with locations of all matched hotels and style definitions.
